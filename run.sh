#!/bin/bash # selecting bash as the shell to run the script
python main.py # running the main.py script using python

# Note: Ensure that the script has execute permissions. You can set this using the command:
# chmod +x <path to your run.sh file>
# This will allow you to run the script directly from the terminal using ./run.sh
# Make sure you have Python installed.
# HAVE FUN LOL!
